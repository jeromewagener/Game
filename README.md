Yet another 2D retro adventure game skeleton which is half baked

First VCS commit. (Before I had everything on my Dropbox... ) 

This first version is heavily based on a Game Programming Tutorial by
TheChernoProject. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw)

The music comes from my Brother (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDl1iIh7gLkSwG9DGhRblBg)
